          <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
          <p>Julian (that's me, in case you were wondering) is an independent
            web developer and singer songwriter
            based out of Maple Ridge, BC. His projects and music vary
            considerably but he is mainly focused on creating his own music
            and building websites with the magic of HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery,
            etc. etc. At present Julian is working on his first album "Deliberation"
            and on building his web development business. Julian once sold his
            soul to devil to get guitar chops. He thinks he may have been conned.
